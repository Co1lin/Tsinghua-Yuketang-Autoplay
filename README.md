# Tsinghua Yukuotang Autoplay

This script can autoplay the course videos.

## How to use?

Install it from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/422349-tsinghua-yuketang-autoplay) to your browser with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension.

Open one of the videos in some course. Since the numbers at the end of the URLs are increasing (though not continuous) as the course progresses, this script will automatically open the URLs with incremental numbers. The URLs that have no video on their pages will be skipped quickly.

## Disclaimer

The script is written for JavaScript programming practice only.
